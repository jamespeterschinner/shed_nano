Hello this is code for the arduino Nano (atmega328P, 5v) board. 

This nano is controlling a 24 channel controller for led lighting. 

The controller currently implements soft switching on the main power relay upstream from the Meanwell LDD-300 dc-dc converter chips by shutting down all channels prior to switching. 

The input device for the controller operates via a push button rotary encoder and is programmed to use the two hardware interput pins.
